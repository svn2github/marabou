Some simple tools are provided to histogram the
variables contained in a root tree (in the simplest case
just a NTuple). Clicking on a tree produces a list
showing the variables of the tree. Just clicking into a
name displays a 1-dim histogram with a default binning,
the range is calculated from the first few 1000 values.
A table is presented with default Nbin, LowX UpperX which
may be edited. These defaults can be saved for the same
or a later session activating the option 
<a href=options.html#Help_on_RemParTrees>Remember hist limits when showing trees</a>
from the <a href=options.html>Various HistPresent options</a> pupup menu.
<p>
A scatter plot is produced by selecting 2 variables by
pressing the grey button left of the name (which turns into
green) and then clicking <b>Show leafs</b>. Pressing the green
button deselects it.
<p>
To display not just the value itself but an expression of it
press Edit expression. An expression can contain the
variables names explicitly (e.g. sqrt(var1) ) or the name can
be taken from a selection. This is done by putting $1 as a
placeholder. (e.g. Defining an expression: $1&&0xfff and then
clicking on a variables name will select only the lower 12
bit of the variables value. For 2-dim hists expressions like
sqrt($1):$2&&0xfff may be used. Similiarly formula cuts may
be applied by Edit formula cut. (e.g. $1 > 1000 & $2 > 2000).
Applying graphical cuts (TCutG) are possible by giving the
name of a memory resident TCutG and the 2 variables names
used for the cut. 
<p>
A much more general way is described <a href=#Help_on_MakeCode>here</a>

<a NAME=Help_on_MakeCode></a>
<H3>Use of a root macro</H3>

A simple and powerful way to analyze data contained in a
tree is achieved with the help of a ROOT macro. A
skeleton code is generated with the MakeCode method of the
tree class. The following interactive session demonstrates
this:
<pre>
root [0] TFile f("hsimple.root")
root [1] f.ls()
TFile**         hsimple.root    Demo ROOT file with histograms
 TFile*         hsimple.root    Demo ROOT file with histograms
  KEY: TH3F     hpx;1   This is the px distribution
  KEY: TH2F     hpxpy;1 py vs px
  KEY: TProfile hprof;1 Profile of pz versus px
  KEY: TNtuple  ntuple;1        Demo ntuple
root [2] ntuple->MakeCode();
Macro: ntuple.C generated from Tree: ntuple
root [3]
</pre> 
ntuple.C will now contain the skeleton C++  code.

Detailed information can be found in the class descriptions
of TTree and TCutG in ROOTs WWW site, the ROOT HOWTOS
contain useful examples.
