<TITLE>Operations on histgrams</TITLE> 

<H1>Operate on selected histgrams</H1> 

If two histograms (or more for Add) are selected one can
perform the following operations:
 
+ Add: hist1 + factor*hist2
- Sub: hist1 - factor*hist2
* Mul: hist1 * factor*hist2
* Div: hist1 / (factor*hist2)

The resulting histograms are shown and stored in memory with
new names. Note that in this case the order of selection is
important.

If only 1 histogram is selected with operation multiply then
this gets scaled

For operation Add any number of selections are possible.

Rebin a selected histogram using the selected (green) value.
The new bin content may the sum or average of the original
bins
