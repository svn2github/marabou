<H1>Calibrate x-scale of 1-dim histogram</H1>
The X - scale of of a 1-dim histogram may be recalibrated
providing x-y-points. At least 2 points are required. 
Points can be provided in the following ways:
Activate the option  <b>Enable calibration</b> from the 
<b>Various HistPresent Options</b> menu. Execute a (gauss) fit
to at least 2 peaks in the spectrum from the <b>Fit popup menu</b>. 
Execute <b>Calibrate</b> from the same menu and fill in values
into the presented table. 
If no or less then 2 points are added before <b>Calibrate</b>
the x-y values of the fit points must be filled in by hand.

The user is then prompted for a fit function. As default 
<b>pol1</b> is offered, i.e. a straight line. Giving <b>pol2</b>
would give a polynomial of 2nd degree.
The fitted function may be written to a root file for later
use in an analysis program. 
Note: Use unique and meaningfull names.
If more then 2 parameters (pol1) are fitted currently only
the first 2 (i.e. constant and slope of the polynomial) are
used for the new x-scale. This is because a non linear scaleing
would require a rebinning of the histogram which in general
does not give satisfactory results because of artificial gaps
and peaks.
The calibration values and titles of the x and y axis are 
storedin an ascii-file which name is formed from the resource
<b>HistPresent.LastSettingsName</b> in the <b>.rootrc</b> followed by 
_<i>histname</i>.def
So normally: if the histogram name is <i>hpx</i> the file is named:
<i>defaults/Last_hpx.def</i>
The same calibration might be applied to a different histogram 
by just copying this file and replacing the name of the histogram.

This can also be done by selecting this histogram and the one
to which the calibration should be applied and display them 
in one canvas. In this canvas a popup menu is provided to 
achieve this. See <a href=#Help_on_EnableCalib>Help_on_EnableCalibration</a>

<H1>Option: Enable calibration</H1>
This option can be set in the <b>Various HistPresent Options</b> menu.
The X - scale of of a 1-dim histogram may be recalibrated
providing (more than 1) x-y-points. If this option is active
the user is asked after a fit to a peak if the mean value 
should be added to the list of calibration points.
