<TITLE>What is .rootrc good for?</TITLE>
<h3>The .rootrc file</h3>
In this file ROOT and applications using ROOT remember
various default settings. It normally resides in the
users home directory and the resources stored here
are valid for all sessions of HistPresent. 
Among others the following resources can be added to 
this file. 
<pre>
HistPresent.HelpDir:				  $(MARABOU)/doc/html/hpr
HistPresent.WorkFileName:       q3dparams.root
HistPresent.PrintCommand:       lpr -Paul
HistPresent.LastSettingsName:   defaults/Last
</pre>

In addition parameters set from the various
<a href=#options.html>options menus</a> are remembered in this file.
<p>
Apropos LastSettingsName:<br>
If the path LastSettingsName is defined ranges and scales
(lin - log) of histograms are remembered during and between
sessions in files with names defaults/Last_histname.def.  It
is convenient to use an own subdirectory  (in this example
$CWD/defaults) for this. LastSettingsName may be any legal
pathname e.g. /tmp/$(USER)/ Note:  Use $(USER) instead of just
$USER for compatibility reasons.
