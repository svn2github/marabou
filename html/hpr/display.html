<a NAME=Help_on_Mark></a>
<H1>Use of marks</H1>
Marks are used when expanding and fitting histograms.
They are set pressing the middle mouse button in a
histogram.

If no marks are active the lower and upper edges of the
histogram are used, if only one mark is active the lower
or upper edge is used as the second mark depending on the
position of the InOutSide switch. Marks may be set using
keyboard input. (Set2Marks). They can be converted to
windows. These windows may be written to a workfile to be
used by other programs like cuts in 2dim histograms.


<a NAME=Help_on_Expand></a>
<H1>Expand</H1>
Expand histgram using marks, if only one mark is active
the lower edge is used as the second mark. This builds a
new histogram, under- and overflow bins will be refilled
correctly.
The command Entire shows the full range range again.

To get only an expanded view move the mouse into the
labels of the wanted axis, the cursor should turn into a
hand with a forefinger, press the left mouse button and
drag the mouse to the required position an release the
button. To get back to the full picture use the command
Entire from the Display popup menu.

<a NAME=Help_on_RedefineAxis></a>
<H1>RedefineAxis</H1>
The values of the axis labels may be redefined by
providing new lower and upper limits for the axis.  In
this way the picture can reflect a calibrated spectrum.

Note: This only changes the appearance of the picture.
The histogram itself remains unchanged.

<a NAME=Help_on_Project></a>
<H1>Project</H1>

The commands ProjectX, ProjectY produce projections on the
X or Y axis for a 2-dim histogram. Active cuts will be
applied.

<a NAME=Help_on_ProjectF></a>
<H1>Project along function</H1>

ProjectF will project the difference of the  Y - values to
the values of a function previously generated by a fit (See
Help on Fitting).  The result is the superposition of
slices in X of the 2-dim histogram where each slice is
shifted such that its Y - value equal to the function
value is moved to zero. So the resulting projection on the
Y-axis will be centered at zero.

This allows a banana shaped distribution to be straightened
so the banana shows its real thickness in the Y-projection.

<a NAME=Help_on_ProjectBoth></a>
<H1>Project on X and Y</H1>
The command ProjectBoth produces projections on the
X <B>and</B> Y axis for a 2-dim histogram in the
same picture. The attached figure demonstrates this.
<img SRC="ProjectBoth.canvas.gif"  height=400 width=600 align=ABSCENTER>
The ratio of the space taken by the scatter plot and the 
projections may by adjusted by the parameter
Project_Both_Ratio (see <a href=options.html#Help_on_Default_Window_Sizes>Help_on_Default_Window_Sizes</a>

<a NAME=Help_on_Entire></a>
<H1>Show entire histogram</H1>
Show full range of histogram

<a NAME=Help_on_GetRange></a>
<H1>Show in same range</H1>
Show a histogram in same range as this one. A list of
histograms in memory is presented allowing a selection.


<a NAME=Help_on_Superimpose></a>
<H1>Superimpose</H1>
Superimpose a histogram on existing picture. A histogram can
be selected from a histogram list by pressing the grey
button left of the name. If none is selected a list of
histograms in memory is presented from which selection can
be done. The latter is needed to show histograms which
result from an operation (scaled, summed etc.). histogram.
For 1-dim the  color code is taken from its position + 2
(position 1 gets red etc.) With this command the same scale
is used as for the original histogram.

A command Superimpose scaled is provided for 1-dim hists to
scale the superimposed histogram to the maximum of the
original one in the displayed region.


<a NAME=Help_on_Rebin></a>
<H1>Rebin</H1>
Rebin this histogram using the ROOT builtin command. This
command uses the sum of the bin contents. There is an 
extended <a href=showlists.html/Help_on_OperRebin>Rebin</a> command provided by HistPresent which
produces a new histogram with sum or avarage of the
bin contents selectable.

<a NAME=Help_on_Contour></a>
<H1>User defined contours</H1>
Levels and colors in 2-dim histograms using the drawing 
options <b>colz</b> or similiar are normally automatically 
adjusted using 20 equidistant levels and a color spectrum 
blue-green-yellow-red (rainbow colors).
Levels and colors can be selected using <b>Set User Contours</b>
in  the <b>Display</b> popup menu. Color numbers or levels 
may all be set to 0, in this case the default colors 
(e.g. rainbow)  and the default equidistant levels are used. 
The convention is such that cells with content greater than a xx 
level value and less orequal to the following value get the 
corresponding color. That means cells with content below the 
lowest level are in background color (not visible).
So in the normal case when no cells with negative content 
are present the lowest level should be 0.

These settings can be saved to a rootfile and reused later.
Save is done be the command <b>Save User Contours</b>
Restore is done by selecting the required contour object
in the <b>File list</b> and pressing <b>Use Selected Contours</b>
