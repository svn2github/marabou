<H1>Save cuts as ASCII file</H1>
2-dim windows (cuts) can be written to and read from an
ASCII file. The format is as follows:

Window1name 
npoints 
x1 y1 x2 y2 
.. 
Window2name
npoints 
etc. 

If a file contains 2-dim windows a commandline is
added in the filelist to write out the windows. In the
File popup menu of the HistPresenter main window a command
is provided to read in the windows. The windows are put
into memory and can be accessed in the normal way from the
popup menus provided for 2-dim histograms.
