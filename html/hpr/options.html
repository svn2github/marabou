<H3>What to display for histogram</H3>
This allows to adjust what items should be shown when
displaying a histogram like title, statistics box etc.

<H3>How to display a 1-dim histogram</H3>
Here error bars, filling and contours may be choosen.
Fitting of Gaussian optionally with linear background
when dragging with mouse button 1 pressed can be
switched on and off here.

<H3>How to display a 2-dim histogram</H3>
ROOT has many different ways to plot a 2-dim histogram
like boxes all sorts of lego plots etc.

<H3>Various HistPresent options</H3>
These options are described in some detail below.
<a href=#Help_on_ShowFitted>Help_on_ShowFitted</a>

<H3>HistPresent numerical options</H3>
<b> LogScale_Minimum </b>  
    This allows to set the minimum when logarithmic sales 
    are used
<b> AutoUpdateDelay</b>
    This is the update frequency when using the 
    <a href=showlists.html#Help_on_ShowSelected>automatic update</a> option.

<H3>Default window sizes and positions</H3>
Default sizes of windows for 1-dim and 2-dim histograms 
may be adjusted seperately. Units are in pixels. 
Each new window is shifted according to the values of
Window_Shift_X and Y starting at Window_Top_X and Y.

The window size of histgram lists can be adjusted
by the value of <b>WindowXWidth_List</b> as follows:

> 0 : take value as it is in units of pixels
= 0 : take default value (250)
-1  : calculate width to fit longest item without
      using a scrollbar

The parameter Project_Both_Ratio determines the
space left for the original scatter plot when the
the Display action <b>ProjectBoth</b> is used.

<H3>Default colors and fonts</H3>
This allows to set various colors and fonts.

<a NAME=Help_on_ShowFitted></a> 
<H3>Display fitted curves</H3>
This option controls which curves are drawn if a function
is fitted to a 1_dim histogram. (see <a href=fitting.html>Help_on_Fit_1dim_Menu)</a>
This function is normally is a sum of several components
(Gauss, linear background). As default only the sum of 
the components are drawn. If this option is active all
components are shown allowing a better visual control of 
the fit. An example is given 
<img SRC="Fitted_Curves.canvas.gif"  height=400 width=600 align=ABSCENTER>

<a NAME=Help_on_RemParTrees></a> 
<H3>Remember hist limits when showing trees</H3>
When displaying trees (ntuples) limits for histograms 
(number of channels, lower, upper edge), these values
may be remembered for each tree entry between sessions.

<a NAME=Help_on_RememberLastSettings></a> 
<H3>Help_on_RememberLastSettings</H3>
Remember expand settings (set via marks), calibrations etc.
This option allows to remember for the same and future sessions:
expand limits, log scales, axis titles, 
calibrations i.e. the values of the lower and upper edge of a 
1-dimensional histogram.
Zoomings done by dragging the left mouse in the scale are
not remembered by this option. To do achieve this the option
<b>RememberZoomings</b> must be activated.

<a NAME=Help_on_RememberZoomings></a> 
<H3>Help_on_RememberZoomings</H3>
Pressing the left mouse button in the scale of a histogram
dragging to the required limit allows to zoom in the picture.
Note: The cursor symbol must a hand with forefinger.
This option allows to pass these limits to later sessions.

<a NAME=Help_on_AttrMacro></a> 
<H3>Invoking attributes macro</H3>
Each time a histogram is displayed a macro (FH_setdefaults.C)
may be executed. This macro may be edited from the HistPresent
start menu: <b>EditAttrMacro</b>
This option can be switched on or off.


<a NAME=Help_on_RegExp></a> 
<H3>Use Regular expression syntax</H3>
Normally wild card syntax (e.g. ls *.root to list all
files ending with .root) is used in file/histo selection
masks. One may switch to the more powerful Regular expression.
For details consult a book on Unix.


<a NAME=Help_on_Auto_1dim></a> 
<H3>Auto exec macro 1-dim</H3>
A macro (default name auto_exec_1.C) is executed when the left
mouse button is pressed in a pad containing a 1-dim histogram. 
The default behaviour is as follows:
   In a pad with several hists: display this hist enlarged 
   On a histogram contour:      print info for this channel
   In the statistics box:       print full statistics
   On a function:               print its parameters.


<a NAME=Help_on_Auto_2dim></a> 
<H3>Auto exec macro 2-dim</H3>
A macro (default name auto_exec_2.C) is executed when the left
mouse button is pressed in a pad containing a 2-dim histogram. 
The default behaviour is as follows:
   In a pad with several hists: display this hist enlarged 

   When the mouse is moved:     
   Open a new window and display a histogram containing the
   projection on the x-axis taking only the channels with the
   y-values pointed to by the mouse.
   This feature can be switched by the options:

Auto exec project X 
and
Auto exec project Y
