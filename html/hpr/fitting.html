<H3>Fitting of functions to 1 and 2-dimensional histograms</H3>
HistPresent supports two possibilities to fit functions
to a 1-dim histogram: <a href=#Help_on_Fit_2dim> (2-dim see here)</a>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Fit of predefined functions from a <a href=#Help_on_Fit_1dim_Menu>Popup Menu</a>.<br>
</li>
<li>
User defined function with the help of a <a href=#Help_on_Fit_1dim_Macro>macro</a>.<br>
</li>

<a NAME=Help_on_Fit_1dim_Menu></a>
<H3>Fitting of functions to 1-dim histograms</H3>
From the <b>Fit/Calib/FFT</b> popup menu:
<b>Gaussians with <a href=#Help_on_Tail>tail</a></b>
<b>Exponential function</b>
<b>Polynomial</b>
<b>User formula</b>

Each of the widgets provides an own <b>Help button</b>.
<p>
Marks are used to provide lower and upper limits of the
fitting region.
In case of gaussians with more than 1 peak in addition
the estimated positions of the peaks must be marked.
Marks are set by pressing the middle mouse button.
<p>
The program estimates from this the start
parameters of the fit which are presented and may be
changed. Values may be fixed and bound.<B> When using
bounds please be aware of the warnings in the MINUIT
manual on this.</B> Fitted parameters may be kept as
start for a new fit. As default Minos error analysis
is not done but may be switched on.
<p>
The quality of the start parameters of a fit determine
the speed of convergence. Bad start parameters may lead
MINUIT to find an unwanted minimum. Start parameters
may be checked by drawing the fit function with these 
parameters without actually doing a fit.
<p>


<a NAME=Help_on_Fit_1dim_Macro></a>
<H3>Fitting of 1-dim functions by a macro</H3>
by a user provided macro.

A more general way of fitting is to edit a macro where all
the functionality provided by the TFormula class may be
used. Template macros serving as examples are provided to
start with. This macro contains  2 possibilities to provide
the fit function: as formula or as normal C++ function.
<p>
Currently 4 examples are provided: An exponential + a
gaussian, 2 gaussians with common mean, a Breit Wigner and
3 Landau functions.
<p>
Use the command <b>Edit User Fit Macro</b> to edit the macro. If
the macro given by the name exists this is taken otherwise
a choice menu with the above 4 examples is presented.
Meaningful start values should be given to assure that
MINUIT finds the correct minimum.
<p>
In this case drawing of components of the fit function must
be done in the macro itself.

<a NAME=Help_on_Tail></a>
<H3>Tail function</H3>
A simplified tail function as described in 
NIM 137 (1976) p. 525-536 has been implemented.
The attached picture illustrates this

height=400 width=800 align=ABSCENTER>
..
<a NAME=Help_on_ShowFitted></a>
<H3>Option: Visualize fit results</H3>
Display fitted curves
This option controls which curves are drawn if a function
is fitted to a 1_dim histogram. 
(see <a href=#fitting.html>Help_on_Fit_1dim_Menu)</a>
This function is normally is a sum of several components
(Gauss, linear background). As default only the sum of 
the components are drawn. If this option is active all
components are shown allowing a better visual control of 
the fit. An example is given in the attached picture
<img SRC="Fitted_Curves.canvas.gif"  height=400 width=600 align=ABSCENTER>
</HTML>

<a NAME=Help_on_Fit_2dim></a>
<H3>Fitting with to 2-dim histograms</H3>
2-dim functions can be fitted to a 2-dim histogram with
the help of a user provided macro. 
Use the command <b>Edit User Fit Macro</b> to edit the macro.
If the file doesnt exist a template implementing a 
2-dim gauss function is provided. The result of the
fit is drawn in a separate canvas with the same drawing 
options as used for the 2-dim histogram.
<p>
1-dim polynomials can be fitted in a 2-dim histogram
either to user defined marks or to a profile histogram
projected onto the X-axis with a possible active graphical 
cut applied.
<p>
Functions are named. They may be written on a root file and
retrieved using their names. Parameters, errors etc. may be
made persistent and reused in analysis programs e.g. as
calibration.
