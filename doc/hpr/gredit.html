<h3>Graphics editor</h3>
HistPresent provides an interface to the ROOTs builtin 
graphics editor adding some extra functionality like
an edit grid until they are part of ROOT itself.
<p>
From the <b>File</b> popup menu one can open a canvas for
drawing  as A4 - portrait - landscape or user defined. 
The canvas has buttons giving access to graphic primitives 
like arrows and curly lines.
<p>
To draw e.g. a curly line press the corresponding button in
the toolbar, than at start of the line and  release at the
required endpoint.
For a curly arc press at center and release on the  wanted
circumference. Then invoke with the right mouse button on
the curly arc the popup menu and select Phimin and Phmax.
Angle are measured in degree counter clockwise with 0 at
the positive X-axis. <p>
The default attributes may be adjusted from the 
<b>Graphic_defaults</b> popup menu. This menu allows
to set the attributes of all objects in the current drawing
by activating the <b>Set all</b> checkbutton for the 
desired object. 
<p>
<h4>Use of an edit grid</h4>
An edit grid may be defined, drawn, activated and  removed
from the <b>Hpr-Edit</b> popup menu. For convenience two grids
are provided: the real grid at which objects are aligned
and a visible grid typically choosen 2 times coarser. 
Due to the finite pixel resolution objects may not be exactly aligned
at the grid. Or objects may have been placed with the 
Align_grid_option deactivated. For this a command
<b>Align objects at grid</b> is provided. This command
allows a choice for X and Y and all object types separately.   
The edit grid should normally be removed before the canvas
is printed. If it is saved to file this is done 
automatically.
<p>
<h4>Import of external objects</h4>
<p>
The following objects may be importet:<br>
  - Histograms<br>
  - Graphs<br>
  - Pictures (jpeg, gif, png)<br>
  - Text / Latex<br>
<p>
To insert such an object one first draws a Pad with the
desired size.
Then activate <b>Insert histogram</b> from the <b>Hpr-Edit</b>  menu.
The histogram file / name may be given explicitly or the
the histogram may be selected from <a href=showlists.html#Help_on_ShowFileList>FileList</a>
widget. Text-, label- tickmark sizes may be scaled by a factor.
<p>
Graphs are inserted in the same way.
Pictures are inserted given their names. All names ending with
.jpg and .gif are offered in a listbox.

Text / Latex may be inserted from a text file or from
a text widget. This widget also provides a listbox
with the history.
Text is inserted line by line. On an external file joining
of lines is accomplished by the backslash character.

ROOTs formala class uses a Latex like syntax. The main
difference is the hash (#) character which replaces
Latex s backslash (\) character. Super- Subscripts
must always be inclosed by braces, even single characters.
Optionally a filter may be switched on which tries to
translate Latex to ROOTs Latex.  

<h4>Compound objects</h4>
Members of compound objects are selected enclosing them by 
a graphical cut (TCutG). This is defined by selecting the 
<b>scissors</b> symbol of the toolbar icons.  
Pressing the left mouse successively at the required points 
defines the cut. Pressing twice at the same point ends 
the cut.
Choosing <b>Mark as compound object</b> allows the members 
to be shifted ore deleted together.
<b>Extract as compound object</b> creates a new object 
which is added the the list of compound objects. 
The objects in this list are drawn in a separate canvas as  
icons. Pressing the icon allows insertion in the current
picture. A scale factor, an angle and the position may be
choosen. A second scale factor called NDC allows to scale 
text sizes differently.
Compound objects may be written to a file and retrieved
in a later session.

<p>
<h4>Making the drawing persistent</h4>
The picture can be written to a root file and retrieved
later from the contents list of a file.
It may also be saved as a ROOT macro from the <b>File</b> popup
entry <b>Save as canvas.C</b>. The latter  however will normally 
only work for builtin ROOT primitives i.e. the one appearing
in the editor toolbar at top of the canvas.
