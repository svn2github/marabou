<a NAME=Help_on_Mark></a>
<H3>Use of marks</H3>
Marks are used when expanding and fitting histograms.
They are set pressing the middle mouse button in a
histogram.

If no marks are active the lower and upper edges of the
histogram are used, if only one mark is active the lower
or upper edge is used as the second mark depending on the
position of the InOutSide switch. Marks may be set using
keyboard input. (<b>Set2Marks</b>). They can be converted to
windows. These windows may be written to a workfile to be
used by other programs like cuts in 2dim histograms.

<a NAME=Help_on_Highlight></a>
<H3>Highlight marked area</H3>
Fill the area of a 1-dim histogram between 2 marks with a 
selectable color. The fillarea attributes of the generated 
TGraph may be changed afterwards invoking the 
<b>SetFillAttributes</b> popup menu with the right mouse.
Saving the histogram to a file will also save this area.
 
<a NAME=Help_on_Expand></a>
<H3>Expand</H3>
Expand histogram using marks, if only one mark is active
the lower edge is used as the second mark. This builds a
new histogram, under- and overflow bins will be refilled
correctly. Possible active <a href=cuts.html>cuts</a> will be applied.
The command <b>Entire</b> shows the full range range again.
Cuts are ignored.

To get only an expanded view move the mouse into the
labels of the wanted axis, the cursor should turn into a
hand with a forefinger, press the left mouse button and
drag the mouse to the required position an release the
button. To get back to the full picture use the command
<b>Entire</b> from the Display popup menu.

<a NAME=Help_on_Entire></a>
<H3>Show entire histogram</H3>
Show full range of histogram

<a NAME=Help_on_RedefineAxis></a>
<H3>RedefineAxis</H3>
The values of the axis labels may be redefined by
providing new lower and upper limits for the axis.  In
this way the picture can reflect a calibrated spectrum.

Note: This only changes the appearance of the picture.
The histogram itself remains unchanged.
For calibration using a non linear function consult <a href=calibration.html>this</a>. 

<a NAME=Help_on_Project></a>
<H3>ProjectX,Y ProfileX,Y </H3>

The commands <b>ProjectX</b>, <b>ProjectY</b>, <b>ProfileX</b> produce projections
resp. profiles on the X or Y axis for a 2-dim histogram. 
Active cuts will be applied.
 
<a NAME=Help_on_ProjectF></a>
<H3>Project along function</H3>

<b>ProjectF</b> will project the difference of the  Y - values to
the values of a function previously generated by a fit (See
Help on Fitting).  The result is the superposition of
slices in X of the 2-dim histogram where each slice is
shifted such that its Y - value equal to the function
value is moved to zero. So the resulting projection on the
Y-axis will be centered at zero.

This allows a banana shaped distribution to be straightened
so the banana shows its real thickness in the Y-projection.

<a NAME=Help_on_ProjectBoth></a>
<H3>Project on X and Y</H3>
The command <B>ProjectBoth</B> produces projections on the
X <B>and</B> Y axis for a 2-dim histogram in the
same picture. The attached figure demonstrates this.
<img SRC="ProjectBoth.canvas.gif"  height=400 width=600 align=ABSCENTER>
<p>
The ratio of the space taken by the scatter plot and the 
projections may by adjusted by the parameter
Project_Both_Ratio (see <a href=options.html#Help_on_Default_Window_Sizes>Help_on_Default_Window_Sizes</a>

<a NAME=Help_on_Transpose></a>
<H3>Transpose a 2-dim histogram</H3>
Exchange X and Y-axis of 2-dim histogram.
This is useful together with <a href=#Help_on_ProjectF>ProjectF</a>

<a NAME=Help_on_Rotate></a>
<H3>Rotate a 2-dim histogram</H3>
Rotate a 2-dim histogram. This is normally done to align 
structures along the X or Y-axis before project or slice 
operations. 
<p>
The determine the rotation angle a <b>pol1</b> (straight line)
fit to user defined marks should be done before.
Alternativly the angle may be directly given in degrees.
<img SRC="rotate_ex.gif"  height=400 width=600 align=ABSCENTER>
Note: This is normally only useful if X and Y-axis have the 
same scale. The absolute values of the scales are no longer
meaningful.

<a NAME=Help_on_GetRange></a>
<H3>Show in same range</H3>
Show a histogram in same range as this one. If no histogram
is selected a list of histograms in memory is presented 
allowing a selection.

<a NAME=Help_on_ShowStat></a> 
<H3>Show statistics only</H3>
This prints contents, mean, sigma applying active cuts. 

<a NAME=Help_on_Superimpose></a>
<H3>Superimpose</H3>
Superimpose a histogram on existing picture. A histogram can
be selected from a histogram list by pressing the grey
button left of the name. If none is selected a list of
histograms in memory is presented from which selection can
be done. The latter is needed to show histograms which
result from an operation (scaled, summed etc.). histogram.
For 1-dim the  color code is taken from its position + 2
(position 1 gets red etc.) With this command the same scale
is used as for the original histogram.

A command <b>Superimpose scaled</b> is provided for 1-dim hists to
scale the superimposed histogram to the maximum of the
original one in the displayed region.

<a NAME=Help_on_Magnify></a>
<H3>Magnify</H3>
This operation is useful for histograms with many bins.
The (virtual) canvas is extended in such a way that 
one bin spans at least 2 pixels on screen. A scrollbar
is added to allow scrolling through the entire picture.

<a NAME=Help_on_Add_axis></a>
<H3>Add new X-Y axis</H3>
This allows to add an extra X or Y axis at top or on the
right side of a histogram. The axis range may be choosen
different from the original one.

<a NAME=Help_on_Select_Inside></a>
<H3>Select Inside</H3>
This option determines if points inside or outside are
choosen when applying cuts.

<a NAME=Help_on_Log></a>
<H3>Log Y, Z scale</H3>
This option is added for convenience to choose logarithmic
Y or Z-scale. The same can be achievced from a canvas 
popup menu (Right mouse in a canvas outside the borders
of a histogram).
 
<a NAME=Help_on_Rebin></a>
<H3>Rebin</H3>
Rebin this histogram using the ROOT builtin command. This
command uses the sum of the bin contents. There is an 
extended <a href=showlists.html/Help_on_OperRebin>Rebin</a> command provided by HistPresent which
produces a new histogram with sum or avarage of the
bin contents selectable.

<a NAME=Help_on_Contour></a>
<H3>User defined contours</H3>
Levels and colors in 2-dim histograms using the drawing 
options <b>colz</b> or similiar are normally automatically 
adjusted using 20 equidistant levels and a color spectrum 
blue-green-yellow-red (rainbow colors).
Levels and colors can be selected using <b>Set User Contours</b>
in  the <b>Display</b> popup menu. Color numbers or levels 
may all be set to 0, in this case the default colors 
(e.g. rainbow)  and the default equidistant levels are used. 
The convention is such that cells with content greater than a
level value and less or equal to the following value get the 
corresponding color. That means cells with content below the 
lowest level are in background color (not visible).
So in the normal case when no cells with negative content 
are present the lowest level should be 0.

These settings can be saved to a rootfile and reused later.
Save is done be the command <b>Save User Contours</b>
Restore is done by selecting the required contour object
in the <b>File list</b> and pressing <b>Use Selected Contours</b>
<b>Clear User Contours</b> establishes the default 20 equidistant
levels again.

This feature is especially useful to get nice logarithmic 
contour levels. E.g.: Just define contour levels 1, 10, 100, 1000,
choose log Z-scale and set <b>LogScale_Minumum</b> to 0 if
the bincontents are integer numbers.
Note: With user contours the picture itself will not change
      when switching lin - log, only the color palette (Z-scale) 
      will change.
