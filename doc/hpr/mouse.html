<H3>Usage of the mouse (pointer)</H3>
In general mouse button 2 (middle) is used to set  
<a href=display.html#Help_on_Mark>marks</a> used in fitting and window setting operations.
Button 3 (right) triggers a popup menu provided by the selected 
object.
Actions triggered by mouse button 1 (left) depend on the object
below the pointer:
<UL>
<LI>If it points to a command button obviously the command is 
executed if it points to a name in a Filelist a list of contents 
will be presented etc.
</LI>
<LI>If the pointer is inside the frame of a histogram pressing and
dragging button 1 will popup a window showing  bin-numbers,
x -y values and content of the current bin and the integral
in the dragged region.
Optionally a fit of Gaussian plus a linear background is done
in real time when moving the mouse. This option can be switched
on and off from the <a href=options.html>option</a> item: 
<B>How to display a 1-dim histogram</B> or  <B>How to display 
a 2-dim histogram</B>
This feature may also temporarily switch off and on for the 
current canvas from the <B>ROOT-Options</B> popup item 
<b>Pad Auto Exec</B> 
</LI>
<LI>If the pointer is inside the X- Y- or Z-scale of a histogram 
pressing button 1 and dragging will zoom into the dragged region. 
Unzoom may be done invoking the popup menu by button 3.
</LI>
<LI>If the pointer is inside the statistics box its content is 
printed to the transcript window.
</LI>
<LI>If the pointer is inside a canvas with several histograms the
selected histogram is shown in a separate window. 
This is described in more detail <a href=showlists.html#Help_on_ShowSelected>here</a>
