The command <b>InitCut</b> allows to select an area enclosed
by a polygone to be used as a cut in expand and function
fitting. Corners are set by clicking the left mouse button
in the scatterplot. Successive clicks at the same position
ends the input. Any number of cuts are possible. This
commands adds the defined cut to the active ones.
<p>
Cuts are stored and retrieved by names. A default name is
provided which can be changed during creation or by invoking 
a popup menu for the cut by pressing the right mouse on
the contour line of the cut.

<p>
Windows in 1-dim histograms can be defined with the
command <b>MarksToWindow</b>. (See also <a href=display.html#Help_on_Mark> Help on Marks</a>)
<p>
To use a cut stored on a file one proceeds as follows:<br>
Pressing the field with the file name in a <a href=display.html#Help_on_ShowFileList>filelist</a>
will display the contents of the file including the cuts.
Pressing the grey button on the left side of the name of the cut 
will bring this into memory.<br>
The item <b>ListCut</b> from the <b>Cuts/Windows</b> popup 
lists cuts currently in  memory. Active cuts are
marked green. Pressing the select button toggles between
active and passive. Pressing on the field with the name
the values are displayed in a table an can be modified.
See <a href=#Example_Window_1D>Example of a 1-dim Window</a>. 
<p>
Cuts and windows can be written to and read from a file
(either root file or ASCII file ) See <a href=#Help_on_SaveCuts>Help_on_SaveCuts</a>
<p>
W a r n i n g:
The number of entries when applying a cut to a 2dim histogram
might differ from the result when applying the same cut 
in a replay program or when showing data stored in a root tree.
This is because the x-y values in a 2dim histogram are taken
from the bincenter, the original real values are lost during
filling. In the replay program the real values are used.
This effect is especially big if the cut traverses regions
where the contents density rapidly changes.

<H3>Save cuts as ASCII file</H3>
2-dim windows (cuts) can be written to and read from an
ASCII file. The format is as follows:
<p>
Window1name 
npoints 
x1 y1 x2 y2 
.. 
Window2name
npoints 
etc. 
<p>
If a file contains 2-dim windows a commandline is
added in the filelist to write out the windows. In the
File popup menu of the HistPresenter main window a command
is provided to read in the windows. The windows are put
into memory and can be accessed in the normal way from the
popup menus provided for 2-dim histograms.

Once a cut has been constructed it can be moved around or 
modified with the left mouse button. At the time the button
is released the statistics inside the cut is calculated
and one line with: Content, MeanX, SigmaX, MeanY and SigmaY
is printed on the terminal window. When pressing key <b>m</b> 
inside the canvas a marker with this parameters is generated.
These markers can later be used to fit a polynomial through
them. See  <a href=fitting#Help_on_Fit_2dim>Help_on_Fit_2dim</a>
