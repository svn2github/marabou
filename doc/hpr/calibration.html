<H3>Calibrate x-scale of 1-dim histogram</H3>
The X-scale of of a 1-dim histogram may be recalibrated
providing x-y-points. 

<h2>This refers to new version ( >= root_v5.14/00):</h2>

The procedure to use previously fitted peaks is as follows:
  - Use the <b>Fit Gaussian (with tail)</b> dialog to perform 
    the required fits (Activate the Option </b>Add all functions
	 <b>Note:</b> This may be done via the <b>FindPeak Dialog</b>
	              with subsequent <b>Fit Gaussian Dialog</b>
  - If this is done before the <b>CalibrationDialog</b> is invoked,
    the table in  the <b>CalibrationDialog</b> will have as many
    rows as peaks are defined. The default number is 3
  - Invoke this widget (<b>CalibrationDialog</b>) 
    Execute (Click) <b>Update Peaklist</b>
  - Fields <b>Mean</b> and <b>Errors</b> of the table should now
    be filled. Complete / modify the table at least  with
    <b>Nom Val</b> (Nominal values)
  - Execute <b>Calculate Function</b>, the function is drawn
    in a seperate canvas.
  - If the result is reasonable possibly modify the parameters
    for the <b>Calibrated Hist</b>
  - Execute <b>Fill Hist</b>. A new histogram will be created
    and filled according to the calibration function.
    Note: Each entry in the original histogram is randomly 
          shifted within its bin before the calibration is
          applied to avoid binning effects.

- The Calibration function may be any legal <b>TFormula</b>
  in practice polynomials of 1. or 2. degree (pol1, pol2)
  are used
- Calibration functions may be saved to and restored from
  a root file.
