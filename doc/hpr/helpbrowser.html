<H3>Howto use the HelpBrowser</H3>

This class implements a simple HelpBrowser typically used in an.q
interactive application where a standard browser like Netscape
appears to be too clumpsy and takes away too much resources
especially space on the screen. It does n o t support internet
references (e.g. http:) but only file refs. It does n o t
support display of the Web documentation of ROOT.

It accepts input in HTML format but does not recognize all
possible tags.  currently only the following tags are recognized
(others are just ignored):

[Hn]  					Heading i.e. highlight line 
[B],[I] 				   bold, italic 
[a NAME=xxx][/a]     an anchor
[a href=yyy]text[/a] 	a reference (may not be http:) 
[img SRC=pict.canvas.gif]  insert a gif picture

The constructor is normally called with the name of a directory
containing  html-files to be included into the documention.  NB:
A file index.html containing the entry level hrefs should be
part of this directory. If the complete documentation is in one
htmlfile the name of this file may be given instead. Also a
ROOT-file containing ready made documentation can be given (see
method ToRootFile below); More files / directories may be added
using the method: AddHtml

It chops text between anchors  into help items.  Text before the
the first anchor gets the name of the the file as name of the
help item. This is useful to construct an index which works also
for a normal browser like netscape. If a reference is clicked on
only the text for this item is displayed.  The window size is
adjusted to the number of lines. It is assumed that the help
text is preformatted, so no formatting is done except optionally
breaking lines at fMaxLineLength. A possible image is displayed
in a separate window.

To display the helptext the method: DrawText(anchor_name, xpos,
ypos) should be used. When help items should be added to a popup
menu the method DrawText(index, xpos, ypos)

As an extension ROOT-files containing canvases may be  defined.
If an image with name "pict.canvas.gif" appears in the
documentation a root-file with name "pict.canvas.root" is
searched for in the same directory. i.e. the convention is to
replace the suffix .gif by .root  If not found xv is invoked for
the gif-file. Otherwise the the canvas contained in the
root-file is drawn. This allows a standard browser to be used
and still have the possiblity to exploit the interactive
features of root when showing a canvas. Begin_Html An example
(for HistPresent) can be found [A HREF="hpr/index.html"]here[/A]
End_Html
