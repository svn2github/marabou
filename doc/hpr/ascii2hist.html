<TITLE>Convert ASCII data to histgrams / graphs</TITLE>
<H3>ASCII to histograms</H3>
The following input formats are handled to convert 
data given as numbers (double) in a plain ASCII file 
to a histogram:
<ul>
<li>
<B>Channel contents </B><p>
In this case the N values in the ASCII file are assumed
to be the contents of the 1 - N channels of the spectrum.<br>
A histogram with N bins, low egde 0, upper edge (double)N
is created.
</li>
<li>
<B>Channel contents, Errors </B><p>
Same as above, the second value is the bin error. 
</li>
<li>
<B>X values of histogram </b><p>

A histogram is created and incremented at X with weight 1

</li>
<li>
<B>X values, weights</b><p>

Same as above, the histogram incremented at X with 
weight . 
</li>
<li>
<B>X-, Y-values of 2dim histogram  </b><p>

A 2-dim histogram is created and incremented at X, Y 
with weight 1

</li>
<li>
<B>X-, Y-values, weights of 2dim histogram  </b><p>

A 2-dim histogram is created and incremented at X, Y 
with weight.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all cases (hopefully) reasonable defaults are provided
for the histogram parameters. 

<H3>ASCII to graphs</H3>

The following input formats are handled to convert 
data given as numbers (double) in a plain ASCII file 
to a TGraph or TGraphErrors:
<ul>
<li>
<B>X, Y of TGraph (without errors)</B><p>

A TGraph with X, Y values is created.
</li>
<li>
<B>X, Y, ErrorX, ErrorY of TGraphErrors</B><p>

A TGraphError with X, Y, ErrorX, ErrorY values is 
created.
</li>
<li>
<B>X, Y, ErrorXlow, ErrorXhigh, ErrorYlow , ErrorYhigh 
of TGraphAsymmErrors</B><p>
</li>
</ul>

A TGraphAsymmErrors with X, Y, ErrorX, ErrorY values is 
created.

Graphs may be drawn in the same window. To use this 
feature use the file popup menu of the canvas into
which the graph should go and select the option:
<b>Draw in same window</b>
