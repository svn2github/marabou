1. Compiletime requirements
---------------------------

  libfileParam.a only needs os APIs for file opening and closing. Therefore
no special libraries are needed at compiletime.

2. Linktime requirments
-----------------------

  See compiletime requirements.

3. Runtime requirments
----------------------

  At runtime a file is opened containing data in a tcl-shaped way (arrays are
sets of parameters with a succeeding array index number in the tcl idx). When
calling the constructor conParam(), the library looks for the enviroment
variables DAQSLOW_PARAM_FILE and DAQSLOW_STORAGE_FILE. If set, these files
are used to read respectively write back parameters. The default values for
these filenames are 'param.tcl' and 'storage.tcl'. The first file has to exist
and contain tcl-shaped lines to set variables or comments.
  If using conSetupParam() instead, the character string given to the
constructor is used to define the setup. The files are named
<setup>_p.tcl respectively <setup>_s.tcl. If 'NULL' is given to the
constructor, "default" is used as the setup name.
  Param_getBlob() simply opens a FILE-stream and therefore uses the path given
by a Param_getFilename()-call, so the tcl-source has to contain a variable with
a correct path as a value.

4. Known bugs and further developement perspectives
---------------------------------------------------

- Although users now claim to have tcl on all of their systems, libfileParam.a
  has been developed further to fix the most severe bugs and include the new
  features of the version 0.2. Nevertheless, not all of the features of tcl are
  supported correctly. Only the 'set'-command is read and builtin-variables
  (like access to the enviroment) are not available. The treatment of comments
  can be different to that the tcl-interpreter likes.
- Up to now, the different behavior of the sscanf()-function in Linux and
  LynxOS make it necessary to distinguish between both via precompiler-defines,
  which is not set up properly up to now. So this version only supports
  Linux-operating systems while LynxOS-calls are proven to fail at all.
