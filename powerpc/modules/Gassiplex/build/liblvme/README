lvme -- library for VME access

This is version 1.3 of lvme, the library that allows
unified code for vme access throughout the HADES collaboration.

This release has been implemented and tested on the following platforms:
CES RIO-PPC-LYNX-2.5.1, CES RIO-PPC-LYNX-2.4, CES FIC-68K-LYNX2.2,
ELTEC E128-PENTIUM-LINUX, ELTEC E7-68K-LYNX-2.5
It was not tested on ELETC E7-68K-OSK but since the last test on that
system no changes in the OSK part were made, so it is supposed to work.

Address modifiers are still not completely handled, especially under
Lynx on E7, A24 is not tested yet.

The Makefile works on Linux and Lynx w PPC and 68K.
For OSK special commands must be used to produce lvme.r.

Two example programs exist (in subdirectory "examples"):
  testlvme makes word (16bit) accesses to the specified addresses / bits
  bar checks special functions on several modules of giessenTronic and
  GSITronic

Caveats:
  not all address modifiers are honored.
  alignement to page boundaries is not checked on all platforms
  
Changes from version 1.2:
- A function LVme_cleanup() has been implemented that monitors all VME memory
  mappings and therefore destroys them all when called. This can be used in
  signal handlers to leave even the realtime systems based on LynxOS in a
  defined state when the program is killed or dies due to a failure.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2:
- Block Move Access for CES-Lynx

Changes to be expected:
- change of simple functions to macros (the PPC compiler seems
  to do no inlining :-(), be careful when using arguments with side
  effects
- proper handling of address modifiers as far as hardware-possible
- more than one simltaneous vme mapping for linux

Future directions (open for discussion):
- debug version to check for out of bound access, unaligned access etc.
- block transfer
